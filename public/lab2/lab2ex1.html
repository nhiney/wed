        <p style="margin-left: 90px;padding-bottom: 5px">
            Have you seen the "Series 2004 $20 Notes"? The U.S. Treasury
            has rolled out yet another revamp of the U.S. twenty dollar bill in an effort to stop those pesky
            counterfeiters
            once and for all. It features high-tech fake-busting elements like a watermark, a security thread, and
            color-shifting ink. It also features crappy design.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 90px;padding-bottom: 5px">
            I'm not going to concern myself here with a critique of the
            front of the bill (my friend Jeff says "it looks like something got spilled on it."). It's the note that's
            driving me crazy.

        <h2 style="color: red;margin-left: 90px">Too Many 20s</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 90px">
            In particular, it's all those little 20s haphazardly sprinkled in the white space. They are
            nails-on-a-chalkboard to my visual designs
        </p>

        <div id="section" style="display: inline;width: 100%">
            <div id="content" style="width: 70%;display: block">
                <p style="margin-left: 90px"> Are they supposed to be another security feature? ("They'll NEVERbe able
                    to duplicate
                    this $20... look at
                    those 20s... they're all OVER the place!") Did they let a summer intern at the Bureau of Engraving
                    and
                    Printing design it? ("Hey, let Jimmy try it!") Were they concerned the $20 bill might be confused
                    with a
                    $10? ("What this 20 needs is a LOT more 20s.")</p>

        <h2 style="color: saddlebrown;margin-left: 90px">Connect-the-Dots</h2>


        <p style="margin-left: 90px">There must be more to it. My theory: the new 20s contain subliminal
            connect-the-dots messages, like tiny constellations. So, perhaps the 20s connect to form a secret message
            designed to stimulate the economy ("SPEND MORE") or boost patriotism ("WE'RE NO.1").</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 90px">I'm not sure I've successfully cracked the code, so I'm asking for your help. I
            encourage you all to get a new $20 bill, connect the dots to find the message on the back (pencil is best),
            and mail it to me for review. Together, we can get to the bottom of this.</p>
